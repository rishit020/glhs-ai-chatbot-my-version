  "summary": "Wake Tech’s Career & College Promise (CCP) program allows eligible North Carolina high school students to take tuition-free college courses that count toward a degree, diploma, or career credential, often earning both high school and college credit at the same time. CCP includes college transfer pathways designed to satisfy general education and prerequisite requirements for four-year universities, as well as career and technical education pathways that lead to industry-focused certificates and workforce preparation. Program rules, eligibility benchmarks, and dual-credit allowances are governed jointly by the NC Community College System and NC Department of Public Instruction, with local implementation details specific to Wake Tech.",

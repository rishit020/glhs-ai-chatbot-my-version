The Wake County Public School System has determined that the following courses will be available to middle school students.\nPlease note that teacher-led courses taught for high school credit at the middle school may require specific teacher certification.\nCourse Name Course Code if Offered on NCVPS Course Code if Offered at Middle School or\nWCPSS Online\nEnglish / Language Arts\nEnglish I * 10212Y0V 10212Y0\nMathematics\nNC Math 1 21092Y0V 21092Y0\nNC Math 2 * 22092X0V 22092Y0\nNC Math 3 * 23092X0V 23092Y0\nPrecalculus * 24032Y0V 24032Y0\nWorld Languages\nFrench I 11012Y0V 11012Y0\nSpanish I 11412Y0V 11412Y0\nFrench II 11022Y0V 11022Y0\nSpanish II 11422Y0V 11422Y0\nIf schools are unable to accommodate the scheduling of the courses as teacher-led courses, then the courses may be taken online via NCVPS. (See\nchart for details). Math courses can be substituted for grade level math courses.\nCourse codes for high school courses available for middle schoolstudents are noted above in the chart. These are the only coursesthat middle school\nstudents are eligible to take for high school credit.\nHigh school courses taken at the middle school level will be placed on the high school transcript. Grades will show as the grade earned. High school\ncoursestaken in middle school will count as creditstoward high school graduation but will not be counted as a part of the student’s high school grade\npoint average (GPA).\n* Middle school students do not receive honors credit; however, it is recommended that the student take NC Math 2 and NC Math 3 and English I at\nthe honors level so that they are prepared for the next learning.\nHigh School Coursesfor Middle School Students: Frequently Asked Questions(FAQ)\n1. Will the grades earned in high school courses taken in middle school appear on the high school transcript?\nYes. The grade will be listed on the transcript under Grades 6, 7, or 8 with one unit of credit.\n2. Will the grade earned be included in the student’s grade point average (GPA)?\nNo. Only courses taken during the high school years will be included on the student’s grade point average.\n3. Can a student repeat a course for credit at the high school level?\nStudents are permitted to repeat a course to build a stronger foundation for future learning.

A student who earns at least a 2.5 weighted high school grade point average OR a minimum test score on either the ACT\n(19) or the SAT (1010) is eligible for review by any of the 16 UNC System universities. A student must still take either the ACT or the SAT to be\nconsidered for admission. All applicants must submit a valid score as part of their application to any individual institution. Please note that while\nthese are the minimum requirements for consideration, they do not guarantee acceptance.\nUNC System Minimum Admission Requirements\nFour (4) Credits in language, including:\n● Four (4) credits in English emphasizing grammar, composition, and literature.\nFour (4) credits in mathematics in any of the following combinations:\n● NC Math 1, NC Math 2, NC Math 3, and one credit beyond NC Math 3\nIt is recommended that prospective students take a mathematics credit in the 12th grade.\nThree (3) credits in science, including:\n● At least one (1) credit in a life or biological science (for example, Biology),\n● At least one (1) credit in a physical science (for example, physical science, chemistry, physics), and,\n● At least one (1) laboratory course\nTwo (2) credits in social studies, including,\n● One (1) credit in United States History\nAn applicant who does not have a credit in US History may be admitted on the condition that at least three (3) semester hours in\nthe subject will be passed by the end of the sophomore year.\nTwo (2) credits in English, mathematics, science, social studies, world languages, or computer science.\n• These courses should be selected in alignment with a student’s academic and career objectives. Completion of two\nsequential world language courses is recommended.\nReference: UNC Minimum Admission Requirements\nPromotion Requirements\nHigh school students shall be promoted by attaining credits that are earned through successful completion of specific courses as illustrated in the\nfollowing charts. Note that the appropriate English credit is required for promotion each year.\nApex, Apex Friendship, Athens Drive, Broughton, Cary, Crossroads FLEX, East Wake, Enloe, Felton Grove, Fuquay-Varina, Garner, Green Hope,\nGreen Level, Heritage, Holly Springs, Knightdale, Leesville Road, Middle Creek, Millbrook, Panther Creek, Rolesville, Sanderson, Southeast Raleigh,\nSouth Garner, Wake Forest, Wakefield and Willow Spring High Schools.\nFrom Grade Promotion Criteria Credits\n9 English I; two credits in the areas of mathematics, social studies, or science;\nand three additional credits\n\n10 English II; one credit in mathematics; one credit in social studies; one credit\nin science; and two additional credits\n\n11 English III; enrollment in a program which, if successfully accomplished, will\nresult in the completion of graduation requirements\n\nLongview, North Wake College & Career Academy, Phillips, SCORE Academy, Vernon Malone College & Career Academy, Wake Early College of\nHealth & Sciences, Wake Early College of Information and Biotechnologies, Wake STEM Early College, Wake Young Men’s Leadership Academy,\nWake Young Women’s Leadership Academy\nFrom Grade Promotion Criteria Credits\n9 English I; two credits in the areas of mathematics, social studies, or science;\nand one additional credit\n\n10 English II; one credit in mathematics; one credit in social studies; one credit\nin science\n\n11 English III; enrollment in a program which, if successfully accomplished, will\nresult in the completion of graduation requirements\n\nStudents should check with their counselors for information on additional promotion requirements.\nReference: WCPSS Board Policy 3420, Student Promotion & Accountability\nCourse Requirements\nCourse Loads\nIn the high schools, each student shall carry a course load equal to the number of instructional periods in the school day, unless special permission is\ngiven to the student by the principal. Students approved for Career & Technical Cooperative Education programs or for dual enrollment in postsecondary schools are exempt from this policy.\nCourse Selection\nNo two required English courses may be taken concurrently except in extenuating circumstances as approved by the principal.\nEach student served by the Wake County Public School System may request any course listed in this program guide. The system has the potential of\noffering each course, subject to sufficient minimum student enrollment and adequate staffing and materials. Additionally, due to facility limitations,\nsome courses can be taught only in certain schools. A student who wants to pursue a program of study not available in the school to which he/she\nis assigned should request a transfer through the Office of Student Assignment. Students granted a transfer for course selection must provide their\nown transportation.\nCourse Withdrawal Penalty\nStudents are not allowed to drop a course after the first ten days of school. If a student withdraws after the ten-day period, a failure (WF) is noted\nas the grade and the course is counted as a course attempted with no quality points earned. This action will result in a lower grade point average for\nthe student.\nGrades, Grade Point Average (GPA), Class Rank & Honors\nGrading System\nThe grading system for all WCPSS high schools is established in WCPSS School Board Policy 3400 R&P.\nLetter Grade Standard Course Honors Courses AP Courses\nA 4 4.5 5\nB 3 3.5 4\nC 2 2.5 3\nD 1 1.5 2\nF 0 0 0\nStudents will receive one extra quality point for Community College courses approved by the Comprehensive Articulation Agreement (CAA).\nIndependent college and UNC system courses will also earn one extra quality point. Official AP and IB courses will earn one extra quality point.\n Students in selected Project Lead the Way courses will earn one extra quality point. Extra weighting is indicated in the course description. Reference:\nNC State Board Policy GRAD-009 (section 3)\nGrading Scale\nThe following grading scale applies to all high school courses.\nA = 90-100 B = 80-89 C = 70-79 D = 60-69\nF = less than 60 I = Incomplete WP = Withdraw, no penalty WF = Withdraw, with penalty\nThere are times when schools must enter historical grades representing courses not taught in NC public schools. These courses may be from sources\nsuch as community colleges, colleges/universities, home schools, and private schools. If these courses are recorded with a numeric grade, school\ndistricts will use that grade to enter into PowerSchool. However, some of these courses are only documented with letter grades. In those scenarios,\nthe school will use the following conversion chart provided by the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction:\nLetter Grade Numeric Grade Conversion\nA, A+, A- 95\nB, B+, B- 85\nC, C+, C- 75\nD, D+, D- 65\nF 55\nGrading Period, Interims, and Report Cards\nReport cards are issued to students every nine weeks. Per WCPSS School Board Policy 3400, interim reports will be issued to all students at the\nmidpoint of each quarter.\nFinal Exams & NC Assessment Requirements\nAs outlined in WCPSS Board Policy 3410, the Wake County Board of Education believes that an effective testing and assessment program evaluates\nthe progress of individual students and helps ensure that educational goals and objectives are being met for every child. A testing and assessment\nprogram also assists in the continued refinement of the instructional program.\nHigh school students must take all end-of-course (EOC) tests, Career & Technical Education state assessments (CTE Post-Assessments), and other\ntests as required by the State Board of Education. The results of EOC and CTE post-assessment exams will count as 20 percent of a student’s final\ngrade in each high school course for which there is an EOC test or CTE Post-Assessment. This requirement does not apply to EOC tests for students\nfollowing the Occupational Course of Study. In courses without a state assessment, the final exam will also count as 20 percent of the student’s final\ngrade.\nIn 2024-2025, EOC tests will be administered in the following courses: NC Math 1, NC Math 3, Biology, English II. (Important Note: Students without\na valid Biology EOC score or code will be expected to participate in the State EOC administration when enrolling in AP or IB Biology.)\nFor the 2024-2025 school year, Students in Grade 12 may be exempt from exams based on the following criteria:\n• Students must have a projected final grade of B or higher.\n• Students must have 10 or fewer absences in the course.\n• Students cannot be exempt from state testing including field testing.\nThe principal (consistent with GS 115C-288) has final authority to determine a student's exemption status.\nGrade Point Average (GPA)\nA student’s grade point average (GPA) is calculated by adding all quality points earned while in high school (grades 9-12) and dividing by the number\nof courses taken. The weighted GPA includes any additional quality points earned by taking Honors/AP/IB courses, while the unweighted GPA does\nnot include any additional quality points. Courses that are assigned Ps and credits earned via Credit by Demonstrated Mastery (CDM) do not count\ntowards the overall GPA. Students who have questions about how their GPA is calculated should meet with their counselor.\nClass Rank\nThere shall be periodic compilations of class rankings in high school for the purpose of making an individual student’s class rank available to the\nstudent, his/her parent, and to other institutions, such as colleges/universities for the purpose of college / university admission and/or scholarships.\nTo determine class rank, each high school uses final course grades, dividing the total number of quality points divided by the total number of credits\nattempted. The results are rounded to the fourth decimal place. Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate courses, Community College\ncourses included on the most recent Comprehensive Articulation Agreement Transfer List, and courses taught at four-year universities and colleges\ncarry one (1.0) extra quality point. Honors courses carry one-half (0.5) extra quality point. This program guide designates courses with weighted\ncredit with an “AP” or “HN.” To obtain information about which courses carry weighted credit, as well as general information about class rank,\nstudents should consult with their counselors.\nA Senior Honorsrank is calculated and awarded in accordance with Policy 3450, Class Rankings.

(See\nchart for details). Math courses can be substituted for grade level math courses.\nCourse codes for high school courses available for middle schoolstudents are noted above in the chart. These are the only coursesthat middle school\nstudents are eligible to take for high school credit.\nHigh school courses taken at the middle school level will be placed on the high school transcript. Grades will show as the grade earned. High school\ncoursestaken in middle school will count as creditstoward high school graduation but will not be counted as a part of the student’s high school grade\npoint average (GPA).\n* Middle school students do not receive honors credit; however, it is recommended that the student take NC Math 2 and NC Math 3 and English I at\nthe honors level so that they are prepared for the next learning.\nHigh School Coursesfor Middle School Students: Frequently Asked Questions(FAQ)\n1. Will the grades earned in high school courses taken in middle school appear on the high school transcript?\nYes. The grade will be listed on the transcript under Grades 6, 7, or 8 with one unit of credit.\n2. Will the grade earned be included in the student’s grade point average (GPA)?\nNo. Only courses taken during the high school years will be included on the student’s grade point average.\n3. Can a student repeat a course for credit at the high school level?\nStudents are permitted to repeat a course to build a stronger foundation for future learning. Students wishing to do this should make a written\nrequest to their principal or principal’s designee. When students choose this option, please note:\n• Students will receive a numerical grade and both grades will appear on the high school transcript.\n• If the course isrepeated at the high school level, the grade earned will factor into the GPA. Only courses taken at the high school level\nare included in a student’s GPA.\n• Students will not receive credit towards graduation for the second attempt with the course.\n• Students repeating a course for credit will take any associated End-of-Course (EOC) assessment. Those students who have already\nscored at Level 3, 4, or 5 on the associated EOC assessment may elect to retake the EOC or use the previous passing score as 20% of\ntheir final grade. If the student retakes the EOC, the higher of the two scores will be used in the calculation of the final grade.\n4. Do exploratory world language classes (6th Grade, 9 week) count toward earning high school credit?\nNo. Exploratory or Introductory world (foreign) language classes do not count toward earning high school credit due to the limited amount of\ninstructional time.\n5. Which world language course(s) must students successfully complete in order to earn one unit of high school credit?\nSuccessful completion of all courses included in the Level I curriculum series.\n6. Are students required to take a final exam for world language course(s)?\nYes, a district final exam will be given after the completion of the Level I curriculum courses.

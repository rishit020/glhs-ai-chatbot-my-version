QUICK FIX FOR DEPENDENCY CONFLICTS
===================================

The issue: langchain-core got upgraded to 1.0.2, but langchain-ollama needs < 1.0.0

SOLUTION - Run these commands in your terminal:

1. pip install "langchain-core==0.3.76" --force-reinstall
2. pip install "langchain==0.3.25" "langchain-community==0.3.25" --force-reinstall
3. pip install -r requirements.txt

OR just double-click fix_dependencies.bat (I've updated it)

After running, test with:
python -c "import langchain; import langchain_community; import chromadb; print('Success!')"

If that works, your app should run fine!
